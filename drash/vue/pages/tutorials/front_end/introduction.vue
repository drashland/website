  h2-hash About Jae
  p Drash has the ability to power a front-end with the help of its Tengine middleware. Specifically, its Tengine middleware and default template engine: Jae. Jae allows you to:
  ul
    li
      p Create templates with template variables
    li
      p Extend templates
    li
      p Add template partials
    li
      p Add in-template JavaScript
  p The idea behind Jae is to help you create applications stacked with a front-end framework such as Vue, React, and Angular. Essentially, the idea is to help you create a single page application (SPA).
  p If you want to get started using Jae, follow the Tengine documentation in Drash's middleware repository <a href="https://github.com/drashland/deno-drash-middleware/tree/master/tengine">here</a>.
