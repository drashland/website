  h2-hash Before You Get Started
  p A global member is any "thing" you define the global member to be. It can be a service, an app, an array, a number, etc.
  p You can add global members to the <code>Drash.Members</code> namespace via <code>Drash.addMember()</code>.
  p Adding global members is helpful when you want to access a "thing" without having to remember where it's physically located. This prevents you from having to import like <code>import MyThing from "../path/../to/../some/../dir/my_thing.ts"</code>. Instead, you can add your "thing" as a global member (e.g., <code>Drash.addMember("MyThing", myThing);</code>) and access it like <code>Drash.Members.MyThing</code>.
  p All global members are added to the <code>Drash.Members</code> namespace.

        | Hello from MyThing!
      p As you can see, <code>app.ts</code> knows nothing about <code>MyThing</code>. All it knows is that it should be registered as a global member and that it can use it without having to import it.
