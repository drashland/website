  h2-hash Overview
  p In this tutorial series, you will learn how to create a Drash server within a Docker environment. You will use the <code>docker-compose</code> command and Nginx or Apache acting as the proxy to pass connections to the Drash server. You will learn how to set up the <code>.dockerfile</code> files and configure Nginx or Apache for your Docker environment. You will also learn how to serve static <code>.js</code> and <code>.css</code> files.
  p Although this tutorial has code blocks that you can copy and paste, it is highly recommended that you read about #[a( href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/" ) Docker Compose] so you have knowledge of how it works.
