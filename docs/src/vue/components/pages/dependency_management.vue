      p Note: Drash's <code>deps.ts</code> file updates frequently to be compatible with the latest Deno version, so the version numbers on this page may not be the same as Drash's current <code>deps.ts</code> file.

      p As you can see below, Drash's <code>deps.ts</code> file contains many <code>export</code> statements. These statements allow Drash's source code to <code>import</code> any module that is exported from this file.

        code-block-slotted(language="typescript")
          template(v-slot:title) deps.ts
          template(v-slot:code)
            | {{ example_code.deps.contents }}
      p See the example code below. Drash's <code>response.ts</code> file requires <code>STATUS_TEXT</code> and <code>Status</code>. Instead of grabbing these modules directly from a URL, it references the <code>deps.ts</code> file &mdash; allowing it to use the same modules that other files in Drash are allowed to use. Some concerns regarding this method as a dependency management tool are addressed in <a href="https://deno.land/manual/linking_to_external_code" target="_BLANK">Linking to third party code</a> in Deno's <a href="https://deno.land/manual" target="_BLANK">Manual</a>.

            | {{ example_code.response.contents }}
      p A very important task you must take on when handling your dependencies is writing tests for all of your core logic. That is at the very least. Drash, for example, has unit tests that ensure different types of servers (e.g., servers with/without middleware, servers with different HTTP methods, etc.) can be created, pinged, and send responses accordingly. This is how Drash maintains upgrading its dependecies without issues. If there is an issue, it is easily identified and fixed before a new release is made.
